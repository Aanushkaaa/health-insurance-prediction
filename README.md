# health-insurance-prediction
Using IBM AutoAI, we automate all of the tasks involved in building predictive models for different requirements. You see how AutoAI generates great models quickly, which saves time and effort, and aids in a faster decision-making process. You create a model from a data set that includes the age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking preferences, region, and charges to predict the health insurance premium cost that an individual pays.

When you have completed this code pattern, you understand how to:

Quickly set up the services on IBM Cloud to build the model
Ingest the data and initiate the AutoAI process
Build different models using AutoAI and evaluate the performance
Choose the best model and complete the deployment
Generate predictions using the deployed model by making REST calls
Compare the process of using AutoAI and building the model manually
Visualize the deployed model using a front-end application
